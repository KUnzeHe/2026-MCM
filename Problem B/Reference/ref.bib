abstract = {NASA has developed a comprehensive safety process for complex programs. Integral to all programs are relevant safety requirements which establish hazard controls, typically without regard to the likelihood of corresponding failure modes. NASA has added the Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) to the suite of tools for complex space programs. This paper reviews the use of PRA across NASA's human spaceflight programs and examines how the scope and influence of the methodology have evolved over time. Although there is a tendency to focus on the final numerical result of a PRA, its true value lies in the complete PRA model—including the identification of top failure modes that contribute to overall risk. This insight enables both design and operational decisions aimed at reducing those contributors and improving overall system safety. PRA was first introduced during the operational phase of the Space Shuttle Program—not as part of the original design—but as a tool for ongoing program evaluation and improvement. A similar approach was taken with the International Space Station (ISS), where PRA was applied post-design to support maintenance planning, operational rule development, and crew training. In the Commercial Crew Program (CCP), PRA became integral to the design process, with formal thresholds for Loss of Crew (LOC) and Loss of Mission (LOM) used to guide system development in parallel with traditional safety requirements. In contrast, for the Artemis program, PRA is used solely as an evaluation tool to inform program management and communicate risk. A key limitation of PRA is its dependence on data to estimate the probability of failure. For newer programs with limited operational history, generating this data involves considerable subjectivity, with varying methods and assumptions across organizations. To strengthen the consistency and credibility of PRA, it is recommended that the space industry develop a consensus-based approach—bringing together NASA, commercial providers, and spaceflight participants to align data inputs, modeling practices, and application scope.}

abstract="The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is a subsystem typical of crewed space vehicles which provides all the necessary conditions in order to make life in space possible. In its first section, this chapter places the focus on human life and the requirements which should be fulfilled in order to establish a human presence in space. The second section will discuss all tasks of a life support system resulting from these requirements. Moreover, different ways of classifying life support systems will be presented; available life support methods and technologies will be described and also some examples of life support system design will be given. The chapter will be concluded with an outlook on bioregenerative life support systems and how the subsystem ``life support'' is integrated in the overall system ``space station''.",

Due to energy, space and mass limitations physical/chemical processes have been used and will be used in water recovery systems of space stations in the near future. Based on the experience in operation of Russian space stations Salut, Mir and International space station (ISS) the systems for water recovery from humidity condensate and urine are described. A perspective physical/chemical system for water supply will be composed of an integrated system for water recovery from humidity condensate, green house condensate, water from carbon dioxide reduction system and condensate from urine system; a system for water reclamation from urine; hygiene water processing system and a water storage system. Innovative processes and new water recovery systems intended for Lunar and Mars missions have to be tested on the international space station.}

abstract = {The cost and design requirements for transporting satellites and payloads to space using existing orbital technology remain prohibitively high. Yet, quantitative sustainability assessments to evaluate system costs and impacts of existing and proposed orbital transportation systems have been rare. Space elevators are a proposed orbital transportation system intended to safely, gently, and inexpensively transport satellites and other payloads to and from space on a routine daily basis. This life cycle assessment (LCA) was completed to quantify, assess, compare, and suggest improvements to the potential environmental and financial performance of three proposed space elevator system designs, namely i) a One-Tether Initial Space Elevator (the base design) ii) a Two-Tether Initial Space Elevator iii) an Additional One-Tether Space Elevator. A sensitivity analysis to compare the impact of reduced utilization capacity of the space elevator system was also performed. Results indicated the Additional One-Tether Space Elevator scenario had the lowest environmental impact, while the Two-Tether Initial Space Elevator scenario had the lowest production cost per unit mass delivered to orbit. This LCA identified system elements for targeted impact reduction, e.g. operational impacts could be significantly reduced by improving the sustainability of terrestrial transportation delivery systems to the space elevator port. Sensitivity analysis results showed producer cost to be the only impact category with a direct inversely correlated response to reduced capacity; all other impacts showed less sensitivity to utilization reduction. Ultimately, the proposed space elevator design was found to be an environmentally and financially sustainable option for orbital transportation. Further application and refinement of such sustainable engineering and quantitative sustainability assessment methodologies to spacecraft, rocket, and other existing and proposed orbital transportation systems and industries is highly recommended.}

abstract = {As the number of artificial satellites in earth orbit increases, the probability of collisions between satellites also increases. Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments, each of which would increase the probability of further collisions, leading to the growth of a belt of debris around the earth. This process parallels certain theories concerning the growth of the asteroid belt. The debris flux in such an earth-orbiting belt could exceed the natural meteoroid flux, affecting future spacecraft designs. A mathematical model was used to predict the rate at which such a belt might form. Under certain conditions the belt could begin to form within this century and could be a significant problem during the next century. The possibility that numerous unobserved fragments already exist from spacecraft explosions would decrease this time interval. However, early implementation of specialized launch constraints and operational procedures could significantly delay the formation of the belt.},

abstract = {With the increasing accessibility of commercial space flight, the environmental impacts of space launches will become increasingly significant in the coming years. Here, for the first time, a review is presented of the environmental impacts of space launches, specifically of emissions from commonly used solid and liquid rocket propellants. While there are a number of environmental impacts resulting from the launch of space vehicles, the depletion of stratospheric ozone is the most studied and most immediately concerning. Solid rocket motors are the subject of most of the environmental studies on rocket launches, while the now more commonly used liquid rocket propellants are underrepresented in the literature. The limited studies of emissions from rocket engines using liquid propellent reveal that while they do result in stratospheric ozone loss, solid rocket motors are responsible for orders of magnitude greater loss. The comparison of commonly used propellants highlights the environmental trade-offs that must be made when selecting a launch system. This review highlights the need for further study of the cumulative impacts that frequent space launches have on all areas of the environment, including global climate, ecosystem toxicity, and human toxicity, and with consideration given to all commonly used propellants, to ensure that the impacts are well characterised and well understood before the number of launches greatly increases.}
